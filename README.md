# Students_control
**A CRUD application accounts students, groups and courses.**
Firstly database is populated with randomly generated data. 
There are 200 randomly generated students, 10 courses and 10 groups. 
Each group could contain from 10 to 30 students. It is possible that some groups will be without students or students without groups.
Each student can have up to 3 courses.

After populating database we are able to work with it using queries and CRUD functional.
For example:
- Find all groups with less or equals student count.
- Find all students related to the course with a given name.
- Add new student
- Delete student by STUDENT_ID
- Add a student to the course (from a list)
- Remove the student from one of his or her courses
